## Static Website Does Not Mean Dummy Website

It's not because your photo gallery is in a static web site that it can't have advanced and user friendly features. We decided to make it static to be secure and fast but without features compromise!

| Sample | Features |
| -----: | :------- |
| **Open-Source Web Photo Gallery Aimed at Sleekness and Speed**<br />The Python generator works over file directories rather than using a database. It creates static files. The result is a static, fast and secure web site.<br /><br />[Discover More...](#performance) | ![Scan photo albums video](doc/img/myphotoshare-5-scanner.mp4) |

## Install It

### Debian/Ubuntu package

The easy way with the [Debian/Ubuntu package](https://gitlab.com/pmetras/mps_debian/-/releases). Install it with a command like `sudo dpkg -i myphotoshare_VERSION.deb` after changing for the `VERSION` you downloaded.

Then drop some pictures into `/usr/local/share/media` directory and wait for the scanner cron task to update the cache during the night.

Or start an update right now with the command `myphotoshare_scanner /etc/myphotoshare/myphotoshare.conf`. But perhaps you'll like to set a few personal options in the configuration file `/etc/myphotoshare/myphotoshare.conf` before...

### Detailed Manual Install

If you prefer to keep control and understand how it works, follow the [Setup and update instructions](https://gitlab.com/paolobenve/myphotoshare/-/blob/master/doc/Install.md). We'll explain how to get the latest revision from [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/paolobenve/myphotoshare) and setup a web site step by step.

## Start Your Media Gallery in 6 Easy Steps

1. You must have a web server to display your gallery.
1. [Install MyPhotoShare](#install-it).
1. Adapt the configuration file [`myphotoshare.conf`](myphotoshare.conf.defaults) to your liking. At a minimum, you must change 3 settings to locate where are the media albums and where is the web content.
1. Drop pictures and videos into the `albums` directory.
1. Run MyPhotoShare scanner: look for `myphotoshare_scanner` command or `bin/scanner`. This populates MyPhotoShare cache and creates indexes.
1. When the scanner has completed successfully, aim your web browser at your web site and enjoy!

## Under The Hood: How Does It Work?

MyPhotoShare consists of two segments â€“ a Python script and a JavaScript application.

The Python script scans a directory tree of images and videos (we use media as a general term), whereby each directory constitutes an album. It then populates a second folder, known as the cache folder with statically generated JSON files and thumbnails. It writes the `options.json` file too in the html root folder, putting inside it all the options from the configuration file. The scanner extracts metadata from EXIF tags in JPEG photos and other data from videos or `album.ini` user-defined files in albums to create JSON index files in the cache. MyPhotoShare is smart about file and directory modification time and it will be quite fast if there are few or zero changes since the last time you ran it.

The JavaScript application consists of a single `index.php` or `index.html` page. It fetches the `options.json` file and the statically generated JSON files and thumbnails on the fly from the cache folder to create a speedy interface.

### Performance

#### Scanner Performance

As a term of comparizon, on a medium-sized PC, with the images on a NFS mounted NAS partition:

- Scanning with face detection for the first time a 692 photos directory tree for a total size of 2.3 GB takes about 700 seconds (about 1 sec/media, 1 media/sec); face detection takes about 267 ms/photo.
- Re-scan of "all OK" tree of 36,000 media files for a total size of 87 GB takes about 14 minutes (20 ms/media, 50 media/sec) if not using checksums, and about 90 minutes (110 ms/media, 9 media/sec) when using checksums.
- Scanning for the first time about 40,000 photo with less than 100 videos takes about 5 hours with checksums enabled.
- Scanning of videos takes a much longer time than photos, the larger the videos the greater the time.

#### Memory Usage

Scanning 45,000 media requires no more than 1.5 GB/2.1 GB of resident/virtual memory.

#### Javascript Code

The javascript app is optimized, and it works fluently with 40,000 media!

However, showing an album or clicking on a marker with more than 1,000 photos, slowlyness is expected. Despite the slowlyness, everything ends correctly and is still usable.

#### Cache Size

Of course, static web performance is traded against cache size on disk. We tried to keep it reasonable. The cache size ratio to the original albums size depends on multiple factors, like the number of intermediate picture sizes you want (see option `reduced_sizes` in configuraton file) and the video encoding options (see `video_preset` for instance) or video length.

| Site                | Number of Media        | Album Size | Cache Size | Cache / Album Ratio |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------: | ---------: | ------------------: |
| AlternaTV Demo      | 95 pictures            |     675 MB |     116 MB |                 17% |
| Production Site # 1 | 14K media (20 videos)  |      95 GB |      25 GB |                 26% |
| Production Site # 2 | 20K media (439 videos) |      92 GB |      66 GB |                 71% |
| Production Site # 3 | 26K media (430 videos) |     232 GB |      82 GB |                 35% |
